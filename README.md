# Prework - *Images showcase*

Submitted by: **Your Name Here**

**Image showcase** is an app that shows random photos taken by various artists form Unsplash

Time spent: **5** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] Users are see a screen with three labels and a button
- [x] Tapping the button changes the screen color to a random color

## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

My favorite pplications are TikTok, Instagram, and Hypic
- I like TikTok becasue of its algorithms that encourage users to post their content and give all posts a boost instead of only display popular posts. 
- I like Instagram because it allows adding music in a post.
- I like Hypic because, unlike photoshop, Hypic can modify photos' features and colors really in just a tap.

App I want to build:
I want to build an app that give outfit inspiration each daily. Users will input temperature, weather status of the date, and tasks or places the users are going on that day. The app will print out multiple outfit suggestions for the user. I want the app to take photos from Pinterest, find matching/similar items on Amazon or similar e-commerce platform to give the user an idea about where to buy those items. 
## Notes

The largest challenges for me when building this app is that I haven't used Swift or XCode before. Thus, I had to spend time to read and play around to get familiar before I can start building an app on my own.
